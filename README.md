## AI-MEDICAL-DIAGNOSTIC-ASSITANT-USING-U-NET-CNN-
|| 4th SEM PBL project , 2023|| . This project takes in electronic medical records such as ct scans and mri scans and passes thro a U-Net convolutional neural network and provides a diagnosis and gives a segmented output for location of tumors

## About the project:
- This project aims to use deep learning specifically CNN (Convolution Neural Network) driven model to detect features of a medical image such as X-rays, CT scans, MRIâ€™s and other medical images to identify certain characteristics in that image and to provide an output accordingly which classifies the image with predicted disease and provides a semantic segmentation highlight the affected areas if any. Hence making the medical world faster more accurate which may serve lifesaving at certain instances
- The model uses a U-Net Convolutional Neural Architecture is used for training all the models.
- U-Net architecture takes in a 2D image with specified features and outputs back an image
- U-Net is a method wherein an image is downsampled and convolved and further upsampled and convolved with skip connections to give back an image array output, hence giving a U- Shaped Convolutional Neural Network.
