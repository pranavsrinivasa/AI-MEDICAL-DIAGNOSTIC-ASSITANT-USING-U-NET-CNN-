## AI-MEDICAL-DIAGNOSTIC-ASSITANT-USING-U-NET-CNN-
|| 4th SEM PBL project , 2023|| . This project takes in electronic medical records such as ct scans and mri scans and passes thro a U-Net convolutional neural network and provides a diagnosis and gives a segmented output for location of tumors 

## THE MODELS CAN BE DOWNLOADED FROM THE OUTPUT OF THE FOLLOWING KAGGLE CODE LINK
